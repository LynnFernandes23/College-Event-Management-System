Welcome to my College Event Management System, a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate seamless event organization and management within our campus community. This system empowers users to create and manage events effortlessly, allowing participants to register online and administrators to oversee event logistics efficiently. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, with MySQL for database management, our system ensures a responsive and user-friendly experience across devices. From event creation and participant registration to admin dashboard functionalities and automated email notifications, our goal is to enhance the event coordination process. We invite you to explore and contribute to this project, making event management at our college more efficient and engaging for all stakeholders.
